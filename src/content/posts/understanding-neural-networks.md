# Understanding Neural Networks

Neural networks are a powerful and versatile tool for solving many different problems in the world of software engineering. They can be used to solve a wide range of tasks, from recognizing images to forecasting stock prices. In this blog post, we'll dive into the fundamentals of neural networks and explain how they work.

### What is a Neural Network?

At its core, a neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is designed to mimic the way the human brain works. It is based on a network of interconnected nodes, or "neurons" which can process and transfer information. Neural networks can be used to solve complex problems and make accurate predictions.

The concept of neural networks was first introduced in the 1940s and has continued to evolve ever since. Today, they are used for a wide variety of tasks, from computer vision and natural language processing to medical diagnosis and autonomous vehicles.

## Neural Network Architecture

A typical neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. The input layer is responsible for receiving the data, while the output layer is responsible for providing the desired output. The hidden layers are in between and are responsible for processing the data in order to generate the output.

Each layer contains nodes which are connected to the other nodes in the adjacent layers. Each node has a weighted sum of the input it receives, which is then passed through an activation function in order to output a value. This value is then passed to the next layer.

## Activation Functions

Activation functions are used to determine the output of each neuron. They are mathematical equations that take in a weighted sum and output a value, depending on the type of activation function used. Commonly used activation functions include the sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU functions.

### Sigmoid Function

The sigmoid function is commonly used in neural networks to ensure the output is between 0 and 1. This helps in ensuring that the input is within the desired range for the next layer. Mathematically, the sigmoid function is represented as:

$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

### Tanh Function

The tanh function is used to ensure the output is between -1 and 1. This helps in ensuring that the input is within the desired range for the next layer. Mathematically, the tanh function is represented as:

$\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}$

### ReLU Function

The ReLU function is used to ensure the output is between 0 and positive infinity. This helps in ensuring that the input is within the desired range for the next layer. Mathematically, the ReLU function is represented as:

$f(x) = \max(0,x)$

## Training a Neural Network

In order for a neural network to be effective, it must be trained. Training involves providing the neural network with input data and desired output in order to teach the network how to recognize patterns and generate the desired output.

The training process involves adjusting the weights for each connection between nodes until the output of the neural network is close enough to the desired output. This is done using a process called backpropagation, which involves calculating the error between the desired output and the actual output and then adjusting the weights accordingly.

## Applications of Neural Networks

Neural networks have a wide range of applications across many different fields. They can be used for image recognition and natural language processing, among other tasks. They have also been used to solve complex problems in medicine and autonomous vehicles.
